# hello-world
This is my practice repository project for Git-Hub
Hi Everyone!
My name is Benhur Isaac and I am interested in learning how to use gitHub as part of one of the courses in the the IT support specialist 
Certification in Coursera. 

I plan on learning how to automate workflows using Sublime text and making reposotiries to save and modify code. I feel that Git will 
be a useful tool to assist in my journey of learning to code and becoming an IT Support specialist.
